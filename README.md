This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a Simple Next JS project, in which I focused on how client side render works & file based router. 
## Some Benifits of Next Js Over React :

## React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
## In a React project, you have to maintain a separate Backend project for your API routes
## React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
## React is not SEO Optimised 
## Waterfalling problem
