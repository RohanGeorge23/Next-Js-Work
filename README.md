This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a Simple Next JS project integrated with Typescript, in which I focused on how client side render works & file based router. 
## Some Benifits of Next Js Over React :
 React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
 In a React project, you have to maintain a separate Backend project for your API routes
 React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
 React is not SEO Optimised 
 Waterfalling problem



## Next.js provides you the following upsides over React
Server side rendering - Get’s rid of SEO problems
API routes - Single codebase with frontend and backend
File based routing (no need for react-router-dom)
Bundle size optimisations, Static site generation
Maintained by the Vercel team
 
Downsides - 
Can’t be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does server side rendering and hence is expensive
Very opinionated, very hard to move out of it

1.Clone repo
2. npm I
